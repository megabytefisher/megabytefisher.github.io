            <h3>C#, C++, Java - 2016<br></h3>
            <p>Automaton is a tool for automating Android apps. It is composed of two seperate projects: AutomatonHelper, which runs on the Android platform, and Automaton, which serves as a host as tool for setting up AutomatonHelper. The helper program hooks into private Android APIs that allow the app to do things like rapidly grab screenshots from the Android screen buffer or break down the on-screen UI hierarchy. Users run Automaton from a computer and supply it with C# scripts that perform whatever action the user wishes. The two programs communicate over a REST-like API.</p>

            <h3>Objective-C - 2015<br></h3>
            <p>In 2015, I worked for a local computer and iPhone repair shop. One day the owner saw me coding in my free time and asked me to make an iOS app. I quickly learned the basics of Objective-C and wrote the business's app in around a week. The app allowed users to perform basic tasks, such as requesting a quote and opening the Maps app with our location set. It also allowed users to easily call us or upload pictures of their device so that we could more easily identify the brand and model.</p>

            <h3>C, Win32API - 2014</h3>
            <p>While analyzing and debugging a malware sample, I couldn't reliably find a way to set breakpoints that the target program did not either unset or detect. I started researching and devised a novel method of creating pseudo-breakpoints by enabling a Windows feature called "data execution prevention" and setting &nbsp;pages of memory so that they were not executable. This caused an exception to be thrown when the target code was executed, allowing me to set invisble breakpoints.</p>

            <p>In 2012, I launched a project which aimed to completely reverse engineer and reimplement a custom server for an existing online game. Through many hours of work, I produced a game server which could host many clients at once in an online world. I worked on this project for around a year, and eventually started working with a partner. I had to leave the project as I started college, but the project has evolved into an open source project with thousands of commits and lives on to this day.</p>
